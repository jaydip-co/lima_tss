guestPara1 = The German federal law for minimum wages (\u201eMindestlohngesetz\u201c) requires that employees with a monthly income below a certain amount (currently 850\u20ac) fill time sheets about their working hours, vacation, illness, etc. This enables examination and verification of the minimum wage guaranteed by the law.
guestPara2 = in the university context, this means that most of the student assistants have to report the times on a weekly base. Both the student assistant as the employee as well as the supervisor as representa\u0002tive of the employer have to sign the time sheets.
guestPara3 = The TSS shall support the time sheet business. The supervisor and/or a secretary can enter contract data (name of supervisor, name of employee, duration and hours per week) for the student assis\u0002tants. Employees can view their contracts.
guestPara4 = The system keeps track of the hours due and the hours completed. To get an overview, a short de\u0002scription of the work content can be stored. An ideal solution would also support working hour re\u0002ports via mobile devices
